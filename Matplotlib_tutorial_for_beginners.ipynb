Matplotlib is highly efficient in performing wide range of tasks. It can produce publication quality figures in a variety of formats.  It can export visualizations to all of the common formats like PDF, SVG, JPG, PNG, BMP and GIF. It can create popular visualization types – line plot, scatter plot, histogram, bar chart, error charts, pie chart, box plot, and many more types of plot. Matplotlib also supports 3D plotting. Many Python libraries are built on top of Matplotlib. For example, pandas and Seaborn are built on Matplotlib. They allow to access Matplotlib’s methods with less code.\n",
